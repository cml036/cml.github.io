                              In these first two experiments, I tested out two different weights (thickness) of yarn with alternating stitches.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              On the left, one single stitch represents a 1 bit while a hole (skipped stitch) represents a 0 bit. This stitch seems visually interesting and more complex to decode, but it is also not ideal for decryption via computer vision. It is difficult to discern where continuous 1s and 0s are placed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              On the right, one single stitch row represents a 0 bit while a double stitch row represents a 1 bit. While this does seem to have a clearer pattern than the prototype on the left, it is still difficult to determine where 1s and 0s are. If it’s difficult to tell from just looking at it with a human eye, it will be really hard for a computer.

                                In the prototype above, I practiced using different stitches to see which stitch would be best for a final product. I tried to see which stitches have the least gaps and the most consistency. From top to bottom, the stitches used are: single, double, half double, triple, puff, and half-double decrease. Going forward, I will use a single stitch method because it is the simplest and quickest stitch.

                                This prototype uses rows of black and white yarn to encode a message. 1s are represented by a single-stitched black row, and 0s are represented by a single-stitched white row.  Using two different colors, similar to a barcode, will allow for easier computer vision detection. The main challenge will be in distinguishing multiple rows of the same color/number and clarifying an object with a lot of visual “noise” to be interpreted by computer vision.
                            </p>

                                The following image shows the very first complete Insecurity Blanket. Overall, the first prototype was a success. It took approximately 7 yarn bundles and 10 hours to complete, broken up into 3 sessions of crocheting. The final product is snug but still flexible enough to move with. For the live performance of this piece, I will consider using insecurity blankets that I have already started on to reduce the time of the performance.

                                This prototype was created to test with the Processing / OpenCV program. Initially, the program performed image analysis by finding four distinct corners of the square and then reading what was inside the square. This is as close as I was able to get to creating a square with sharp corners. The program worked for uploaded and printed squares, but the crocheted prototype wasn’t clear enough for the program to distinguish the shape. Since I can’t refine the crochet process any further, I needed to change the program.

                              Below is an image of the current crochet scanning program. The program currently takes an uploaded image of the crochet prototype, applies a blur effect and threshold to reduce visual noise on a region of interest (ROI). Focusing on an ROI makes image analysis much easier, and this works with the crocheted pieces well since they are only one-dimensional (can be read like a barcode in one direction, so it doesn’t matter where I sample the analysis from). It maps the pixel’s color in the center of each orange square and maps it to the corresponding binary value (1 or 0) and provides the final bits.
