                                <em>Insecurity Blanket</em> ​consists of both a performance and a collection of sculptural pieces. This piece incorporates the body, poetry, a crocheting performance, and crocheted “cocoons” with Processing and OpenCV technology. Originally inspired by early data storage methods using punchcards, as well as barcodes and QR codes, I use crocheting as a means of data encryption while I use computer vision as a means of decryption. In the performance, I use black and white yarn to represent 1 and 0 bits respectively and to encode messages into my blanket. I crochet each blanket while I am inside of it, creating a snug cocoon around myself. At the same time, a computer vision insecurity blanket reader decodes my messages and presents them visually for the audience. I create barriers that are comfortable yet uncomfortable, expressive yet mysterious, intimate yet isolated. With <em>Insecurity Blanket</em>,​ I explore poetry with cryptography and encryption as well as methodology in art­making and crocheting. Aspects of performance art, process art, and materiality were influenced by artists Janine Antoni, Marina Abramović, and Ann Hamilton.

                                As I started my research, I turned to an early method of programming and computational storage: the punch card. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/07/dayintech_0707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical punch cards</a> were originally used to create computer programs, and were fed into large machines that processed their information and returned the results. Although this was one of the first stages for computer programming, this was not the earliest use of punch cards for storing information. The idea of using punch cards to store information was inspired by the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/07/dayintech_0707/">Jacquard loom</a>. ​The Jacquard loom used interchangeable punch cards to quickly <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/07/dayintech_0707/">switch the pattern of the weave</a>. I found this relationship between archaic, physical punch cards and their distant digital programming relative intriguing. Analog methods could inspire digital ones, and there was something valuable in returning to the past.

                                A clear artistic methodology, complete with iterations and experiments, lays the foundation for I​nsecurity Blanket’s​ success. Prior to working on this project, I had no experience with crocheting, other than receiving crocheted blankets, hats, and scarves from relatives. Learning how to perform different stitches and how to handle the yarn was crucial to creating my piece. Through experience and practice, I could decide what tools were required to achieve my final product. I made several prototypes of both the cocoons and the computer vision program simultaneously, developing my relationship with them and fostering their reliance on one another. I needed to grow with both elements, to become the mediator between two very different mediums. I played with different yarn weights and colors and various stitches to make the blankets readable for the software. I adjusted the software to work with the fairly uneven lines of the yarn. Working with the material aided the creative process, allowing me to learn its capabilities as well as its limitations. Conducting experiments and refining my methods allowed me to find intimacy in an unfamiliar practice, to learn more about it, and to create something that reflects its poetic qualities.

                                The technology in <em>Insecurity Blanket</em> i​s used as a means of communication, especially to bridge the gap between myself and my audience. Using computer vision as a middleman for self­-expression is reminiscent of anonymously posting in an online forum–I give myself the ability to hide and obscure while being seen and understood. Encryption and decryption are important in today’s digital world, but people have been encoding and decoding messages for centuries. Many forms of cryptography have developed over the course of human history, but it has generally been used as a method to keep information secret, safe, and secure. Encrypted messages usually have a specific audience, but can be passed through many hands while enroute to their destination. Interested in ways that data can be visibly stored while still indiscernible to the human eye, I turned to barcodes and QR codes.

                            <p>
                                <a href="http://www.qrcode.com/en/history/">Barcodes</a> store information in one dimension so that they are scannable by optical sensors. Barcodes are typically used in stores on items for sale to make the itemizing process more efficient. <a href="http://www.qrcode.com/en/history/">QR codes</a> were later introduced as a more efficient means of data storage and retrieval because they can store more information in a two-­dimensional image. QR codes and scanning technology was expanded outside of the industrial realm to the public sphere. Although I find the technology interesting and useful, I decided against using QR codes in my project for several reasons. QR codes are visually identifiable, and have a certain cultural context that would be distracting for my purposes. Additionally, I wanted to focus on adapting the technology and yarn to each other. Forcing the yarn into a QR code shape isn’t impossible, but it is time­-consuming and against the nature of the material. Although it is an older method of data storage, it was better to adapt my crochet scanner and crochet cocoons to a one-­dimensional data encryption and decryption system.

                                An important aspect of <em>Insecurity Blanket​ </em>is the process of crocheting and working with a material, using my hands and body to create something that is apart from me while still a part of me. One of my goals with this piece is learning about the processes involved through creation and experience. This piece is greatly influenced by performance and sculptural artist Janine Antoni’s practice. Antoni’s artwork generally focuses on simple, repetitive gestures, yet her final pieces are usually artifacts of her durational performance. She is interested in <a href="http://www.artnet.com/awc/janine-antoni.html">“doing work that [is] about process, about the meaning of the making, trying to have a love­-hate relationship with the object.”</a> Her ultimate goal is to share her experience and relationship that results from <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/2191/janine-antoni">intimacy with materials and methods</a>. In <em>Slumber</em> (​1993), Antoni configures a bed, loom, and polysomnograph machine in the gallery space. She sleeps in the gallery overnight while connected to the polysomnograph to track her sleeping patterns. During gallery hours, she works at the loom and uses her sleeping patterns and pieces of her nightgown to a blanket. She sleeps with this blanket, <a href="http://bombmagazine.org/article/2191/janine-antoni">covered by her dreams</a>, and continues this process for several days. Like Antoni, I want to store information into a physical object and incorporate technology that reads and interprets data. In both S​lumber​and Insecurity Blanket,​our bodies become a connection between two different realms–the physical and the digital. I also believe that it is important to display the final objects, but the performative aspect of creation is equally as significant. With both the stand-­alone cocoons and the crocheting performance, I want to share this relationship I have formed with the materials, technology, and poetry. There are two key elements that distinguish <em>Slumber</em> ​and <em>Insecurity Blanket</em>. ​First, the way that the cocoon is crocheted is counter to traditional crocheting methods because I am inside of the cocoon while I create it. Secondly, the technological and the crocheting performances occur at the same time rather than separately.

                                I was interested in using performance as a means to incorporate the body into my artwork. I also believe it gives me a chance to explore poetry and material intimately and to share that intimacy with others. Performance artist Marina Abramović also focuses on the body as an essential component of art­making, viewing the body as the medium. She engages in durational performances working with the body in space. Like other performance artists of the time, one of Abramović’s trademarks was repetitive and excruciating actions that test both her <a href="http://www.art21.org/artists/marina-abramovic">mental and physical endurance</a>. Her performance with artist and former partner Ulay in <em><a href="http://www.lacan.com/abramovic.htm">Rest Energy</a> </em>(1980) consists of simple yet highly dangerous gesture that relied on trust and mental strength. In the piece, both artists balanced their weight with a bow and arrow, with Ulay <a href="http://www.lacan.com/abramovic.htm">holding the arrow pointed toward Abramović’s heart</a>. Microphones were attached near their chests that <a href="http://www.lacan.com/abramovic.htm">relayed the sound of their heartbeats</a>. In <em>I​nsecurity Blanket</em>,​ I use a simple, durational gesture that reflects a balance between the body, material, and technology. Although my actions are repetitive and durational, they are more related to the nature of crocheting than by my personal design. There is minimal risk involved, but I strive for a balance between comfort and discomfort through the snugness of the cocoon and its conformity to my body. Although my body is a foundational component of the piece, it is not the central focus. Rather, I want the body to highlight the complex relationships between humans and the analog and digital, using the body along with material and technology as a means of self­-expression. It is also crucial for <em>Insecurity Blanket</em> ​to have a material artifact as a remnant of the performance. I want the cocoons as stand­-alone sculptural pieces that can be touched and experienced by others. I want to give my audience a physical and sensory experience that demonstrates the intimacy with material and the body.

                                Through process and performance, <em>Insecurity Blanket​</em> examines materiality and analog methods of making and communication. In the digital age, it can be easy to forget the fundamental need to touch and be touched. Materials also carry their own semantic and nostalgic value that provides a distinct experience in each interaction. I think that yarn is a feast for the senses–the colors are visually appealing, and it is soft, comforting, and irresistible to touch. Artist Ann Hamilton also creates sensual experiences using a variety of materials. In her 1997-­1998 piece, <em><a href="http://www.annhamiltonstudio.com/projects/bounden.html">bounden</a></em>,​ uses hand­-stitched organza, wood embroidery frames, chairs, and a wall tearing water to play with visibility and invisibility of text. Five texts in continuous cursive were hand­-stitched into the organza and exposed to the light from a window. The text was veiled and revealed by the light and shadows, muddling words together. Hamilton marries language with material, developing a physical and mental experience. <em>Insecurity Blanket</em>​ also consists of embedded messages within the material and a relationship between poetry and physical space. Unlike <em>bounden</em>, ​however, the piece does not act alone. It relies on the body and technology to develop a relationship, intimacy, and dependence on one another.
